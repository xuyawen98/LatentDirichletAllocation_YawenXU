# Topic Modeling of Articles on Young University Teachers

This repository contains the R scripts and data for topic modeling analysis of articles from the People's Daily database. The project aims to identify core themes in the coverage of young university teachers over time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models.

## Description

This project analyzes 186 articles from the People's Daily database, totaling approximately 118,000 words, to extract themes related to young university teachers using R and LDA modeling.

## Setup

To run this project, ensure you have the following R packages installed:

- jiebaR
- dplyr
- wordcloud2
- RColorBrewer
- tm
- ldatuning
- NLP
- topicmodels
- tidytext

You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
install.packages(c("jiebaR", "dplyr", "wordcloud2", "RColorBrewer", "tm", "ldatuning", "NLP", "topicmodels", "tidytext"))
```

## Data

The data/ directory contains the text file "追寻记忆的痕迹.txt" used for the analysis.

## Analysis

The load_and_preprocess_data.R script performs the following steps:

    Loads the required libraries.
    Sets the working directory and loads the text data.
    Performs text segmentation using jiebaR.
    Cleans and preprocesses the text data.

The topic_modeling.R script:

    Creates a DocumentTermMatrix.
    Determines the optimal number of topics using ldatuning.
    Builds and inspects the LDA model.
    Extracts and visualizes the top terms for each topic.

## Figures

The figures/ directory will store the output images generated by the analysis, including word clouds and topic-term plots.
Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, execute the load_and_preprocess_data.R script followed by the topic_modeling.R script in your R environment. Ensure the data files are accessible and the output directories are correctly specified.

## Research Methods

The project uses LDA, a type of unsupervised machine learning, to model the latent topics within the text data. The optimal number of topics is determined by analyzing various metrics provided by the ldatuning package. The model's core themes are then extracted and cross-analyzed with temporal factors to reveal patterns over time.
